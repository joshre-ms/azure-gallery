The [Azure Cloud Shell](../articles/cloud-shell/quickstart.md) (in public preview) is a web based shell that is preconfigured to simplify using Azure tools. With Cloud Shell, you always have the most up-to-date version of the tools available and you donâ€™t have to install, update or separately log-in. Just click the **Try It** button at the top right of a code block within this article to launch the Cloud Shell.
