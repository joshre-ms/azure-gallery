## Manage your new Azure web app

Go to the Azure portal to review the Azure resources you created.

To do this, sign in to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).

From the left menu, select **App Services**, and then select the name of your Azure web app.

You have landed in your web app's _blade_ (a portal page that opens horizontally).

By default, your web app's blade shows the **Overview** page. This page gives you a view of how your app is doing. Here, you can perform basic management tasks like browse, stop, start, restart, and delete. The tabs on the left side of the blade show the different configuration pages you can open.

These tabs in the blade show the many features you can add to your web app. The following list is a few of the possibilities:

* Map a custom DNS name
* Bind a custom SSL certificate
* Configure continuous deployment
* Scale up and out
* Add user authentication
