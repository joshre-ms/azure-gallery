  "description": "This image contains a full install of Visual Studio Community 2015 on Windows 10 Enterprise N (Anniversary Update).  As this is the originally released (or \"RTM\") version of Visual Studio, this image contains \"RTM-era\" (pre-Update 1) versions of the optional components - including the originally released Universal Windows Platform app development tools and Windows 10 SDK.  This image also includes the latest Azure SDK.  With this image, you can quickly setup environment in Azure to develop and test applications targeting the Universal Windows Platform.\n\nThis image was created from the latest bits available on 3/14/2017.\n\nThe Visual Studio software is preinstalled in this VM, but you must acquire a Visual Studio subscription separately which allows you to sign in to and run Visual Studio on this VM.",
