Network Security Group flow logs are a feature of Network Watcher that allows you to view information about ingress and egress IP traffic through a Network Security Group. These flow logs are written in json format and show outbound and inbound flows on a per rule basis, the NIC the flow applies to, 5-tuple information about the flow (Source/Destination IP, Source/Destination Port, Protocol), and if the traffic was allowed or denied.

## Before you begin

This scenario assumes you have already followed the steps in [Create a Network Watcher](network-watcher-create.md) to create a Network Watcher. The scenario also assumes that a Resource Group with a valid virtual machine exists to be used.

## Register Insights provider

In order for flow logging to work successfully, the **Microsoft.Insights** provider must be registered. To register the provider, navigate to **Subscriptions**, select the subscription for which you want to enable flow logs. On the **Subscription** blade, select **Resource Providers**. Navigate the list of providers and verify that **microsoft.insights** provider is registered. If not then click **Register**.
