# Create a static HTML web app in Azure in five minutes

This quickstart walks through how to and deploy a basic HTML+CSS site to Azure. Youâ€™ll run the app using an [Azure App Service plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview), and create a web app in it using the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli). You use Git to deploy the app to Azure. It takes about five minutes to complete the tutorial once the prerequisites are installed.

## Prerequisites

Before creating this sample, download and install the following components:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Azure CLI 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Download the sample

In a terminal window, clone the sample app repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/html-docs-hello-world.git
```

## View the HTML

Navigate to the directory that contains the sample HTML. Open the *index.html* file in your browser.

![hello-world-in-browser](media/app-service-web-get-started-html/hello-world-in-browser.png)

[!INCLUDE [login-to-azure](../../includes/login-to-azure.md)] 
[!INCLUDE [configure-deployment-user](../../includes/configure-deployment-user.md)] 

[!INCLUDE [app-service-web-quickstart1](../../includes/app-service-web-quickstart1.md)] 

Create a [Web App](app-service-web-overview.md) in the `quickStartPlan` App Service plan. 
The web app provides a hosting space for your code and provides a URL for to view the deployed app.

[!INCLUDE [app-service-web-quickstart2](../../includes/app-service-web-quickstart2.md)] 

The page is running as an Azure App Service web app:

## Update and redeploy the app

Open the *index.html* file. Make a change to the markup. For example, change `Hello world!` to `Hello Azure!`

Commit your changes in Git, and then push the code changes to Azure.

```bash
git commit -am "updated HTML"
git push azure master
```

Once deployment has completed, refresh your browser to see the changes.
