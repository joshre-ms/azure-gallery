# Connect a web app to a storage account

In this scenario you will learn how to create an Azure storage account and an Azure web app. Then you will link the storage account to the web app using app settings.

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/app-service/connect-to-storage/connect-to-storage.sh "Azure Storage")]

[!INCLUDE [cli-script-clean-up](../../../includes/cli-script-clean-up.md)]

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, web app, storage account and all related resources. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| [az appservice plan create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/appservice/plan#create) | Creates an App Service plan. This is like a server farm for your Azure web app. |
