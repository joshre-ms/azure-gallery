# Create a web app with continuous deployment from Visual Studio Team Services

This sample script creates a web app in App Service with its related resources, and then sets up continuous deployment from a Visual Studio Team Services repository. For this sample, you will need:

* A Visual Studio Team Services repository with application code, that you have administrative permissions for.
* A [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/setup-admin/team-services/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate) for your Visual Studio Team Services account.

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]
