# Monitor and scale a single SQL database using the Azure CLI

This sample CLI script scales a single Azure SQL database to a different performance level after querying the size information of the database. 

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/sql-database/monitor-and-scale-database/monitor-and-scale-database.sh "Monitor and scale single SQL Database")]

## Clean up deployment

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```
